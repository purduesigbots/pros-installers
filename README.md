# pros-installers

This repository contains all of the additional files needed to build the PROS
installers. The Windows folder contains an Advanced Installer project, the MacOS
folder contains a script to build a DMG package, and the Linux folder contains
the scripts necessary to build the Linux packages.

This repository requires you to have already built the PROS CLI and PROS Atom
distribution.
